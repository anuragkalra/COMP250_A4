# COMP250_A4
BFS and DFS search engine that traverses McGill web network

This was assignment 4 in COMP 250 - Introduction to Computer Science class, taught by Professors Martin Robillard and Mohamed Smaoui in Winter 2015.

The goal of this project was to implement some basic functionalities of a search engine. We were given two data sets, "vertices.csv", and "edges.csv", which captured the McGill web network in a graph data structure. Our task was to implement a search function to look for specific keywords, using Breadth-First and Depth-First search algorithms. 

Some code, including a JUnit testing suite, was provided by the professors, but I do not have explicit permission for sharing, so they are not included in the repository.

The Search.java contains the Java sources for both BFS and DFS traversal algorithms along the McGill network.
